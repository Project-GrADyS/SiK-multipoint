Ricky:
	- Improved device detection, should detect most silicon labs devices
	  uniquely now.
	- Fixed missing header files issue with previous test builds
	- Added devel-tools
		- sniffer (minor tweaks to code from Henri Geist)
			Allows sniffing communications between the IDE and an EC2 using the
			serial port.
		- playback test app to playback data captures from sniffer to the IDE.
			Great to try the affect to fiddling with return values to see their
			impact on the IDE.
			This was instrumental in improving the device identification logic.
	- Fix spurious timeout errors on JTAG devices for command 0x04 in
	  ec2_target_reset(),  (trying to rx 1 to many bytes)
	- added system reset code before halt in connect sequence as it seems
	  necessary.
	- disconnect on EC2 fixed
	- Updates to the doc directory.
	- Revised JTAG initialisation sequence
	- Have added warning about --mode=auto because this mode makes the init
	  sequence differ from the SiLabs ide and I did observe some strangeness
	  involving it.
	- Removed EC2test since ec2test-any replaces it and has much less problems
	  and can now support any device in the device table.
	- Remove ec2test-F310 as replaced by ec2test-any (see above).
	- Add command line switches to control tests of ec2test-any, can not turn
	  off blocks of tests, see --disable-xxx options.
	- Added --quick option to allow shortening of some tests in ec2test-any at
	  the expense of reliability.
	  The quick option speeds up tests like the random data random address for
	  various memory areas but does not affect tests that test every memory
	  location.
	- EC3 & C2 reads 0x00's, reordered startup to match IDE,
	  might solve this, seemed to be intermittent.  seems to be fixed but not
	  sure...
	- Only print "ec2 will be slower for ec2test-any" if --port != USB
	- Made protocol reverse enginering details available in cvs as protocol
	  module and also in tgz.
	- Added additional delays in xdata and data RAM reads since the EC2 seems to
	  choke at the rate we send other commands.
	- Fixed Automake makefile.am files so that all necessary header files end up
	  in the source distribution files.
	- Remove commented out code (cleanup).
	- Added ec2drv.spec to allow building of RPMs
	- Updated protocol documentation module with latest data captures and
	  understanding.
	- Increased delays on RS232 communications since we seem to be overloading
	  the EC2 sometimes.
	- Added Support for C2 devices with EMIF (External Memory interface)
	  This makes the F340 pass all tests
	- Marked F340 as tested in device table
	- Fixed F120 XDATA size type, affected other micros is same family
	- Added support for paged SFRs
	- Made JTAG Flash read code more generic
	- raised minimum EC2 version to 0x13 because 0x12 caused problems with
	  missing 0x0d at end of replies etc.  This necessitated extra delays to
	  allow flushing of buffers etc.
	- Added F120 Flash memory read / write support.
	- Added function to check a block of flash accesses will avoid the reserved
	  areas and hooked it up.
	- Added scratchpad test to ec2test-any.
	- Fixed ec2test-any xdata random test and a corruption bug exposed when it
	  was fixed.
	- Fixed 0x0d seen in read data streams caused by not reading terminating
	  0x0d of previous operation in some places (wasn't sent on earlier EC2
	  versions).
	- various fixes for newer gcc versions to allow compilation.
	- split out c2 and JTAG code into a separate file where possible
	- moved much of the debugger bootloader support to its own file boot.c/h
	- Added target debugging test to ec2test-any, breakpoints, stepping etc.
	- Add support for F120 XDATA, register in different location
	- Flash routines now use the paged sfr support.
	- add cache control functions and have flash accessors call them.
	- Removed support for EC2 ver 0x12 as it does not terminate all replies
	  with 0x0d.
	- Update Doxygen comments
	- 8051F120 breakpoints, run, step etc supported and tested.
	- Made C2 breakpoint code generic,  works with F30x and F31X  just needs a
	  simple data capture to support other c2 devices.  Discovered for C2
	  breakpoints are controlled via reserved SFR's!
	- Long standing EC2 bug relating to corruption of data causing some tests
	  to fail.  Caused by newer EC2 versions correctly terminating command
	  replies that older ones didn't and hence ec2drv wasn't reading the
	  extra bytes and this allowed the PC to get ahead of the EC2 causing
	  corruption. this is the FIX that necessitated killing off support for the
	  EC2 0x12 firmware.
	- Hooked Kolja's CRC routine to the bootloader page write function so not
	  upload of new firmware to the EC2 / EC3 are checked.
	- Added version of read_port called read_port_tm which has a millisecond
	  timeout value which is necessary to allow for long operations such as
	  erasing the chip while still allowing a reasonable short time for other
	  operations.
	- ec2-update-fw updated and now has proper command line parameters.
	  Provides a method to unscramble blocks of firmware but the default is to
	  load raw 8051 binaries.  Firmware images will now be provided in
	  unscrambled form for ease of use since each firmware from Silicon labs
	  is scrambled in a different order which just complicated things so it is
	  easier to provide the unscrambled version.
	  The unscrambled uploading and addition of xor 0x55 will make it easy for
	  others to implement their own EC2 firmware.
	- updated firmware tools docs and provide new .raw images.
	- added command lines options to ec2readfw to allow reading the debuggers
	  entire code memory or just the firmware locations.
	- Prevented spurious Failed to halt message from flash write code.
	- modified all tools so that a disconnect is performed on failure or CTRL-C
	  This is to reduce the liklehood of destroying a micro in C2 mode at the
	  next reconnect (only seemed to be a problem on C2).
	- updated ec2writeflash / ec2readflash to support >64k
	- Updated Max firmware versions to EC3 = 0x0c, EC2 = 0x14 as these seem good
	- Added Fixes for library files not including .so reported by Sean Collins.
	  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1668047&forum_id=499982
	- Detect and report presense of but lack of access rights to an EC3,
	  suggesting try as root or setup udev.
	- Add code to support F35x (Paged debug sfr's)
	  (general paged sfr support for c2 mode)
	- Addeed command lines options -ex and -command to newcdb to allow passing
	  of single commands and files containg commands into newcdb on the command
	  line.
	- Define breakpoint SFR's as both page na daddress since different 
	  processors have the sfr's in different banks.  The F530 is the first one I
	  have seen which use a page other than f or no paging.
	  Found in data capture from Sean.
	- Fix Segfault when opening cdb file with too many missing source files
	  reported by Julian.
	- Cleaned up sym_type_tree initialisation and add call to clear the tree 
	  back to the terminal types when the file command is used.
	- Implemented more of the newcdb print command can print arrays and now has
	  default format types.

Henri Geist:
	- bugfix for ec2drv serial communications, to avoid missing part of the read
	  data when only a part of them has arrived at time of the read syscall
	  on the serial port.

Kolja Waschk:
	- EC2/3 Bootloader Read firmware function now fixed. (incorrect byte order
	  in address.
	- Routine to match the checksum/CRC that the EC2/3 calculated on a page of
	  memory.
	- Provided basic read debugger firmware utility.

NebojÅ¡a:
	- Allow compilation with GCC 4.1

Thomas Sailer:
	- Patch containing large number of warning fixes for GCC4

Marco Oesch:
	- Correct EC2 Firmware size for ec2rfw.c, also ensure entire debugger read
	  size set correctly.

Steve Brown:
	- Fix for EC3 not reading enough bytes causing following commands to return 
	  garbage.
	- Provided breakpoint registers for F320/1
	- Confirmed F320 ok with EC3 version 0x0d. (We now accept 0x0d as top version for EC3 firmware)
	- Identifed "copy&paste" stylebug involving debug option in writeflash.c.
	  The fix should make the option work as intended.

Frieder Ferlemann:
	- Identified several compile issues with newer GCC (Ricky added fixes for these)


Julian Lamb:
	- data captures and example code for F340 Beakpoints
	- Fix The step command always stops after the first instruction is run
	  bug in silabs target.
	- Remove "starting program" message from cmdcommon since it duplicates
	  lower layer messages.
	- fixes to cmddisassemble
		- X gives "bad command" always 
		- segfault with command "x /2ig" (with no 3rd arg) 
		- x command doesn't accept >1 digit
		- When using x to print out instructions, it adds a "+1" randomly
		  to Improve formatting.
		- When using x to print out large groups of data, the performance
		  is quite slow.
	- Fixed The context manager doesn't load in more than 1 asm source file
	  bug.
	- Info on DPTR being mapped into 0x27 and 0x28 undocumented registers.
	- Found more registers to be remapped to alternate addresses including 
	  the all important DPTR.  Now "info registers" in newcdb gives the 
	  correct DPTR value :-)
	- Fix can't set breakpoints on asm files.  The command line forces you to
	  add a ".asm" extension to the file name, yet the file name is stored
      without the .asm extension (patch to symtab.cpp)
	- clean up indenting on print_asm_line to make output prettier.
	- Fix  modulemgr doesn't clear out modules between "file" commands.

Known issues:
	- If the device is locked reads from RAM and FLASH return 0x00 rather than
	  reporting an error

TODO:
	- choose correct clock and flash scale values for each processor.
