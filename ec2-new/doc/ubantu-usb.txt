Kolja Waschk provided the following information which allows non root users to use the USB debugger
on Ubantu

It is simple to allow non-root acccess to the EC3 in
Ubuntu with udev; just this line into some udev rules
file, e.g. in /etc/udev/rules.d/30-silabs.rules, and
any member of the "dialout" group will be allowed to
access the device as well:

BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="10c4",
SYSFS{idProduct}=="8044", GROUP="dialout"
