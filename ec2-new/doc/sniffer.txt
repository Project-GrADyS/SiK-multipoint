sniffer
======================================================================

This document details the use of the sniffer test application.
The purpose of this application is to pass RS232 packets between 2 ports on a PC while logging data sent in each direction and also the RTS / DTR handshake signals.

Command line:
	./sniffer 115200 8N1 /dev/ttyS1 /dev/ttyS0 > capture.log


Capturing useful data:
In the contect of ec2drv useful data consists of serveal data captures.
If you are submitting these for help in getting a device to work correctly
please capture different activities to different files or at least add comments.
Please also include which debug adaptor and its firmware version.

	1) SI labs IDE connect
	2) write to a small area of flash
	3) write to all flash (use IDE fill memory commend)
	4) repeat 2 and 3 for different memory areas
	5) stepping through code
	6) anything special to the particular micro that is not in the rest of the devices or is handled differently.
	
	You only need to provide data captures for operations that fail for your device.
	If nothing works first send the IDE connect capture
