USB sniffing
============

Since ec2drv is based on captured communications with an EC2 or EC3 if there is a problem with a particular device it is useful if you can provide data captures of the particular device in use with the windows IDE.


If you have an EC3 and want to trace its communications
You need to get a copy of SniffUSB from
http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/

This program will allow you to capture logs of communications between the
EC3 / Toolstick and the Si Labs IDE on windows.

Capturing useful data:
In the contect of ec2drv useful data consists of serveal data captures.
If you are submitting these for help in getting a device to work correctly
please capture different activities to different files or at least add comments.
Please also include which debug adaptor and its firmware version.

	1) SI labs IDE connect
	2) write to a small area of flash
	3) write to all flash (use IDE fill memory commend)
	4) repeat 2 and 3 for different memory areas
	5) stepping through code
	6) anything special to the particular micro that is not in the rest of the devices or is handled differently.
	
	You only need to provide data captures for operations that fail for your device.
	If nothing works first send the IDE connect capture
